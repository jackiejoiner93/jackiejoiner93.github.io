        <h1>About Jackie</h1> 
        <p> My name is Jacqueline (Jackie) Joiner and I am a junior advertising major at the University of Florida.
        <p>I was born in Gainesville, Fla so I have always considered myself a Gator at heart. I moved from Gainesville to Ormond Beach where I went to school. High school was where my passion for design began.  I was a part of the Academy of Communications and Multimedia Technology which focused its curriculum on Adobe products. Creating visually stimulating things is what I love to do and I hope to utilize my skills that I have gained in high school and college in a future career. My main focus is fashion and beauty and I have a <a href=http://beautyonabudgetuf.wordpress.com> beauty blog </a> that I keep up with on a regular basis. I am still figuring out what my idea of a dream job would be because I just changed my major from journalism in the Fall 2013 semester.</p>
