        <h1>About Jackie</h1> 
        <p> My name is Jacqueline (Jackie) Joiner and I am a junior journalism major at the University of Florida.
        <p>I was born in Gainesville, Fla so I have always considered myselg a Gator at heart. I moved from Gainesville to Ormond Beach wear I went to school. High school was where my passion for journalism began, specifically visual.  I was a part of the Academy of Communications and Multimedia Technology which focused its curriculum on Adobe products. Creating visually stimulating things is my passion and I hope to utilize my skills that I have gained in high school and college in a future career. My main focus is fashion and beauty and I have a <a href=http://beautyonabudgetuf.wordpress.com> beauty blog </a> that I keep up with on a regular basis. My idea of a dream job would be working for an entertainment news publication in the production department.</p>
